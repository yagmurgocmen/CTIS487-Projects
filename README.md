# CTIS487-Projects
A collection of Android Studio projects was completed as part of the CTIS487 - Mobile Application Development course at Bilkent University. Each project demonstrates different aspects of Android app development using Kotlin.

##How to Explore the Projects

Each folder (`Lab3/`, `Lab4/`, etc.) contains an independent Android Studio project.

For each project:
- Main logic → `app/src/main/java/.../MainActivity.kt`
- User interface → `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`
- App resources → `app/src/main/res/values/` and `app/src/main/res/drawable/`

Open the desired lab folder in **Android Studio** to view and run the project.
